      <p>Hi there! &#128075; My name is Manoj Kumar, and I am based in Sydney, Australia &#129432;</p> 
      <p>As part of a hackathon initiative from my bootcamp coding course, I built this web app! &#128640;</p>
      <p>Each student, either working solo or in a group, had the opportunity to create something that utilizes React, NodeJS, JavaScript, and an API. 
        I chose to build a public transport timetable app that helps commuters plan their departure & arrival for their chosen locations. 
        You can choose over 400 cities from across the world covering buses, trains, ferries, etc. 
        As time goes on, I am planning to cover as much of the global transit systems as possible! &#128653; </p>
      <p>Additionally, this is the first web app I have personally ever built and deployed to the world! The launch day (30/5/24) was an exciting day for me! ðŸ¥¹ </p>
      <h1>Thank you!</h1>
      <p>A massive shoutout to the folks (Tim, Mauro, and Adrian) at SkedGo, whose TripGo API was used to make this web app. </p>
      <img src={skedgoLogo} alt="SkedGo Logo" className="skedgoLogo" />
      <p>Their support, patience, and understanding in helping an absolute coding newbie like me amidst their busy work schedule is truly heartwarming &#128079; Please check out their company's products and achievements <a href="https://skedgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
      <p>I also want to thank my tutor Alex and my classmates at my coding institute for helping me test and troubleshoot my app. Love you guys! &#9996; </p>
      <p>Finally, I extend my heartfelt thanks to you for visiting this website, and I hope you enjoy using this app. Your support motivates me to continue dreaming and building &#128151;</p>
      <p>Cheers!<br />Manoj</p>
